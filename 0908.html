<h1>PangHwi WIKI</h1>
This is my third time to making my own web page.
<h3><u>WHO IS PangHwi ??</u></h3>
<p>PangHwi is JKH !! JKH is studying in Dongguk Univ. His major is Computer Science Engineering.
   <br> He is Yebaaa's load. But, He is so powerful that he didn't follow Yebaaa well. </p>





I start HTML class with <strong>Youtube [LIFE CODING]</strong>.
<p>I am happy octopus ~ You are studying in Class "Compiler Composition"
I am free~~~ HaHaHa !!! 
<br>But.. I have to review my major class. Let's study together ! You are not free hee hee</p>

<p>Today I learned about <u>several things</u> in class. </p>
    <p>First, I knew about <strong>difference of tag [br] and [p]</strong>. Tag [p] is more common than tag [br]. If we use tag [p], we have to close our tag. But, It makes information more valuable. On the other hand, tag [br] can use in same situation with tag [p]. Tag [br] can add several empty line as many as you can. </p>
    <p>Second, I realized that <strong>it is important to be chosen by search engine</strong>. Even if my web page is so nice, it doesn't matter to search engine. Search engine analyzes HTML code, and professional code writing is more important for search engine. If we write code more fitted with search engine, our Web page is more accessible to other people. </p>
<h4><strong>Thank you for <u>CHAT JKH</u></strong></h4>
