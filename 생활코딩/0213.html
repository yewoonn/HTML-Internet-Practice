        <script>
            document.write('helloworld');
        </script>

        <h3>What is different with HTML?</h3>
        HTML is static language that 1+1 is always 1+1.
        But, Java Script is dynamic language that 1+1 is <script>document.write(1+1)</script>

        <h3>Script tag</h3>
        script tag indicates that this is the Java Script language.

        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p>
            Event is the work that occurs in web browser. For example, there are onclick, onchange, onkeydown and more.
        </p>
        

        <input type ="button" value = "HI" onclick="alert('HI')">
        <p>
            This type is the button that i can make with Java Script. What i write in value type is the comment inside the button. Lastly, onclick type is function that when we click the button. This type have to be written in Java Script and memorize by web browser to operate. 
        </p>
        

        <input type ="text" value ="Change" onchange="alert('changed')">
        <input type ="text" value ="Key Down" onkeydown="alert('key down!')">
    
        <p>
            This is the text box that i can get some text from user. Onchange functions when it changes something.
        </p>

        <h3>How can i use JS</h3>
        Normally, we can use vs code file to use Java Script. But, We can use console in webpage directly to use JS.
        In this way, we can analyze data simply, without making a file.
        
        <h3>How to control Web browser with JS</h3>
        We have to check the location tag that we want to control.
    
        <input id = "day-night" type ="button" value="night" onclick="
            var target = document.querySelector('body').style
            if(this.value === 'night'){
                target.backgroundColor='black'
                target.color='white'
                this.value = 'day'
            }
            else{
                target.backgroundColor='white'
                target.color='black'
                this.value = 'night'
            }
        ">

        <h3>Program</h3>
        Program is set of order. HTML is just for demonstrating web design. That's why we didn't say HTML is programming language. On the other hand, Java Script is for interacting with user, so we call programming language.
        
        <h3>Refactoring</h3>
        Refactoring is the action that fix code to be more efficient and simple. We can refactor by delete duplicated code. One of the example is function.
