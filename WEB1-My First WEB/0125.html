    <h1>WIKI</h1>
    This is my third time to making my own web page.
    
    <ol>

    <p>Today I learned about <u>several things</u> in class. </p>
    <p>First, I learned how to put image in my web page. It needs to write <strong>attribute</strong> to tell picture's name and size. </p>
    <p>Second, I found that there is <strong>parent and child</strong> tag. For example, there is [li] and [ol, ul]. [ol, ul] is parent tag for child tag [li]. We can classify the group of lists when we use parent tag and child tag. <strong>SO, WHAT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN [ol, ul] ? </strong>
    [ol] is ordered list. we can put number in front of subject. On the other hand, [ul] is just unordered list. So, we can put a dot in front of subject. </p>
    <p>Lastly, I learned <strong>SUPER STAR TAG</strong>. One of them is [head] tag that groups information of documentary. It includes [title] tag which shows title and [meta] tag which informs how to read this documentary. If we use Korean, we should write "utf-8" type. Also, there is [body] tag that groups all of the content in documentary. Above all there is the highest tag that groups head and body. It is [html] tag !!!</p>
