<h1>WIKI</h1>
This is my third time to making my own web page.
<h3><u>WHAT IS HTML ??</u></h3>
<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
   <br> HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. </p>





I start HTML class with <strong>Youtube [LIFE CODING]</strong>.

<p>Today I learned about <u>several things</u> in class. </p>
    <p>First, I knew about <strong>difference of tag [br] and [p]</strong>. Tag [p] is more common than tag [br]. If we use tag [p], we have to close our tag. But, It makes information more valuable. On the other hand, tag [br] can use in same situation with tag [p]. Tag [br] can add several empty line as many as you can. </p>
    <p>Second, I realized that <strong>it is important to be chosen by search engine</strong>. Even if my web page is so nice, it doesn't matter to search engine. Search engine analyzes HTML code, and professional code writing is more important for search engine. If we write code more fitted with search engine, our Web page is more accessible to other people. </p>
